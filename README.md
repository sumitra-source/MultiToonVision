Abstract—  Nowadays, cartoons are widely available in comic books and social media filters, among other formats. They are very important to the entertainment sector, especially in animated movies. They are popular among all age groups, and in the future, they may be used even more broadly, as useful instruments for communication in industries like research, economics, healthcare, and education. From classic print to contemporary social media applications, cartoons now have a big impact across a range of media and age groups. The project's main focus is multi-style cartooning, a technique that turns real-life photos into a variety of cartoon-style visuals while giving customers customising possibilities.
The project proposes a novel approach by combining CDSM (Cross-Domain Style Mixing) with both black-box and white-box approaches. From input photos, the black-box approach quickly creates basic cartoon styles; the white-box approach then explores the internal workings of the model to further enhance these styles. By combining the speed and ease of the black-box approach, the control and precision of the white-box approach, and the creative potential of CDSM, this combination improves the range and quality of cartoon style products.
The combined efforts of the CDSM, white-box, and black-box lead to a very flexible and all-inclusive cartoonization method. This method is significant for its capacity to produce a wide range of excellent cartoon styles from a single input image, demonstrating a noteworthy development in the creation of artistic content in the field of computer vision. The project's results enhance the entertainment sector and provide opportunities for creative visual communication across a range of industries.
Keywords— Cartoonization, Black box approach, White box approach, Cross-Domain Style Mixing (CDSM).
